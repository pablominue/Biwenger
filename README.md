# Biwenger
Biwenger Soccer Fantasy Game Analysis. Programmed in Python Notebook.

This code is a python notebook (I recommend to use Jupyter Notebook to open it). The code extracts data from the Biwenger Api and from the FutbolFantasy HTML code.
All this data is treated in order to extract interesting information, such as the probability of obtaining a player of certain price on an specified pack (bronze, silver or gold).
It also allows you to check how many players there are in a certain range of prices, and to plot a histograms of the number of players for each price range,
and gets the players' probability to be a starter, obtained from the web FutbolFantasy. This data could be cross-referenced with the data extracted earier.
It also has an API Connection to Sofascore implemented to find out the player's average score (Sofascore API Keys required)
